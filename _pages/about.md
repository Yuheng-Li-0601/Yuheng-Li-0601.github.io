Welcome!
Yuheng is a second-year master of mathematics, at Southeast University (SEU). She is a research intern at the College of William & Mary advised by Prof. [Haipeng Chen](https://haipeng-chen.github.io/) since Dec. 2022. Previously, she earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from SEU, co-advised by [Guanghui Wen](https://math.seu.edu.cn/wgh/list.htm), and [Yuezu Lv](https://arims.bit.edu.cn/xztd/jsml/fzhjkxtcyjs/e290539c0192443da93560fa47dfef72.htm). 

Her primary research interests focus on reinforcement learning theory (especially Robust RL) and its applications, combinatorial optimization, and game theory. She cares about two aspects of applications: 
* To handle the uncertainty/adversarial attacks in combinatorial optimization using robust reinforcement learning and game theory.
* Relevant theoretical analysis (convergence, sample complexity, etc.) induced by practical CO problems.
